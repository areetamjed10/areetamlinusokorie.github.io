#This is my first website. 

#This page is going to be your home page... In this section, give a catchy summary about yourself... if a college or university read this page, what are the things you would like them to know about you if they are trying to decide if they would offer you a place in their college or university or if they would offer you a scholarship. 

#Include things like the name of the school you are currently attending... your resume if you have one, outstanding projects you have done and what your interests are. In essence, sell yourself to the school!

##### Favorite Subjects:

I really enjoy math and history, I enjoy math because of the numbers, what makes it fun is crunching down big numbers and using different techniques to solve different advanced question.I enjoy history because learning what happened in the past can really impact what you think of today's society, it can also teach you why some things are what they are and the events leading up to that moment.

#### Achievements:

I’ve been on the honor roll for 2 years in a row and I’m always trying my best in class. Some of my favorite school moments have been getting an award during an award ceremony,getting the most points on a school science fair, and making a massive improvement in a subject I was not so strong in.
